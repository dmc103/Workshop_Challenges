    <p>
        Educators will tell you that IQ is not the only difference between their best and worst students. Increasingly, psychologists are
        finding that the one characteristic that is emerging as a significant predictor of success is not social intelligence,
        or good looks, or physical health, or IQ. It’s grit. It’s been said that grit is living life like it’s a marathon, not a
        sprint. But what is grit? And how can it be nurtured?
